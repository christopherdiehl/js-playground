# What does incognito mode do?

It essentially sets the cache path to a temporary folder. Cookies are still used, but everything starts "fresh" when the incognito window is launched. This applies all storage, including Cookies, Local Storage, Web SQL, IndexedDB, cache, etc.

Of course Chrome also leaves pages out of the browser's history.
